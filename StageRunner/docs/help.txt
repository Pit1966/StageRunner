Tips and tricks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meaning of FX attributes in SEQUENCE MODE.

Automatic next step execution on "Start next FX" :
Set preDelay to -1 and postDelay to desired pause time in ms. This will execute next FX in sequence automatically when started by sequence execute button.

Prevent current FX of being stopped when "Start next FX" was clicked or executed:
Set Hold time of FX that must not be stopped to -1.


FxScript commands:

START { id <FX_ID> | name <FX_NAME> | <FX_NAME_OR_ID> }
	Start FX item from global FX list
	Start FX by name:
		START name <FX_NAME>
	Start FX by ID (given in list ID column)
		START id <ID>
	- If neither "name" nor "id" is given, the parameter is handles as ID if it is a number, otherwise FX name will be assumed
	- You may use wildcard char '*' in order to start multiple FX items with matching names. But only in this fashion:
		START *<NAME_END>  or START <NAME_START>*  or START *<NAME_PART>*


STOP { id <FX_ID> | name <FX_NAME> | <FX_NAME_OR_ID> }
	Stop running FX item from global FX list


FADEIN { id <FX_SCENE_ID> | name <FX_SCENE_NAME> | <FX_SCENE_NAME_OR_ID> } [<FADE_IN_TIME>]
	Fade in FxScene (DMX light scene) from global FX list
	If FADE_IN_TIME is not given, the command will use the default fadein time from FxScene item.

FADEOUT { id <FX_SCENE_ID> | name <FX_SCENE_NAME> | <FX_SCENE_NAME_OR_ID> | all } [<FADE_OUT_TIME>]
	Fade out FxScene (DMX light scene) from global FX list, if it is on stage
	If FADE_OUT_TIME is not given, the command will use the default fadein time from FxScene item.

DMXMERGE <INPUT_NUM> <MERGE_MODE>
	Set DMX merge mode of a connected YADI DMX interface to the given merge mode.
	The merge mode controls how the different DMX inputs are merged and routed to the DMX output of the interface.
	MERGE_MODE
	htp		- highest takes precedence. For each DMX channel the highest value from all inputs are set in the output
	dmxin	- the DMX input will be routed to the DMX output. Computer (USB) output is switched off.
	usb		- the computer (USB) output is routed to the DMX output of the interface. DMX input is off

GRAPSCENE { in | out } <FX_SCENE_NAME_OR_ID>
	Grab current DMX input or output and copy the universe data to specified FX scene
	Example:
	This example script shows how the StageRunner application takes over the control of a lightdesk, fades out the
	current lightdesk output, activate a FX scene and than gives control back to lightdesk

	grapscene in grap_scene				# copy current DMX input to FX scene with name grap_scene (must exist)
	fadein grap_scene					# fade in the grap_scene
	wait 10ms
	dmxmerge 1 usb						# switch to exclusive PC control. Deactivate lightdesk
	fadein light_vision 1000ms			# fade in some arbitrary special scene
	fadeout grap_scene 2000ms			# fade out the grabed scene. This fades out the original lightdesk DMX output
	wait 24s
	fadeout light_vision 1000ms			# fade out the special scene
	fadein grap_scene 1000ms			# fade in the grabed scene. This shows the previous output of the lightdesk again
	wait 2s
	dmxmerge 1 htp						# reactivate lightdesk
	fadeout grap_scene					# fadeout grap_scene. Control is now completly back to the lightdesk


BLACK { video | scene | light | all } [<FADE_OUT_TIME>]
	Black or fadeout FX scenes (DMX) or Video playback or all together.
	If FADE_OUT_TIME is omitted, a sudden black will be done

REMOTE <REMOTE_HOST_ADDRESS> <SCRIPT_COMMAND>
	Execute script commands on remote StageRunner instances available via network connection.
	The commands are send with UDP network protocol
	REMOTE_HOST_ADDRESS may be an IP address or a hostname. (Maybe IP is better, since it don't needs name resolution)
	SCRIPT_COMMAND is any command described here

FADEVOL slot <AUDIO_SLOT_NUMBER> { <TARGET_VOLUME_ABS>|<TARGET_VOLUME_PERCENT>% } [<FADE_TIME>]
	Fade given audio slot to arbitrary volume.
	Use absolute volume scale (0-100)
		FADEVOL 1 70
	or use percentage volume scale
		FADEVOL 1 70%
	(for now absolute and percentage is the same, but absolute volume scale may change in future)
	You may provide a fade time also

MODE [breakoncancel][,disablemultistart][,enablemultistart]
	Set one ore more script execution mode(s).
	breakoncancel: Stopping a script will immediately stop all commands inside the script. Otherwise the script will be stopped
		after the command has finished.
	enablemultistart and disablemultistart: Set if multiple start of FX script is allowed or not

DEFAULT {universe|uni|staticscene|fadetime}
	Set default options for current executed fx(scene)
	universe <UNIVERSE_NUM> : set the default used universe
	staticscene <SCENE_NUM> : set the unvisible static scene used by default. e.g. in DMX command
	fadetime <FADE_TIME>	: defines default fadein/fadeout time

WAIT <TIME>
	Pauses the script for the given time.
	This is an essential feature in order to control the timing of the script commands.
	Example:
	This starts the FX item with id 5 and 5 seconds later it starts the FX item with id 3
		START id 5
		wait 5s
		START id 3

LOOP [<LINE_NUMBER>] [<LOOP_COUNT>]
	Allows to loop a script for the given number times.
	Reaching the LOOP command line, the script will jump to the given LINE_NUMBER, increment the loop counter and break the
	loop if LOOP_COUNT is reached

PAUSE
	Stop execution of script at line position the PAUSE command appears and set the FX script item into paused mode.
	Starting the script again (e.g. by key press, double click or other command) the script will continue execution.

DMX [<UNIVERSE>::][<SCENE>:]<CHANNEL> <VALUE> [<FADE_TIME>]
	Modify static invisible scene SCENE
	Set DMX channel CHANNEL in UNIVERSE to value VALUE with optional fade time FADE_TIME
	CHANNEL can be 1 - 512
	VALUE cab be 0 - 255
	SCENE 1 - 4 (We have 4 static scenes)
	UNIVERSE 1 - 4 (We have 4 DMX universes for now)
	Note: The default SCENE and UNIVERSE is 1, but can be changed with script command "DEFAULT"
